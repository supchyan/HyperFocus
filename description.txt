Have enough forces to fight using true melee? This mod is especially for you!
Mod adds a powerful sword, that will grow its power while owner shows "Super Sexy Skills".
This weapon has two different forms of damage. The first one is activated since you picked up the weapon.
You can charge your weapon while holding it with no getting any damage or you can hit enemies to get the [c/00ffcb:Spirit Form].
[c/00ffcb:Spirit Form]: Weapon does more damage while in Spirit Form. Getting damage resets the Spirit Form.
Right click when in Spirit Form to do a dash through the enemies by splitting the space.
Enemies after getting a hit receives a [c/ff004e:Death Mark]. This mark will hit an enemies until it breaks.
When [c/ff004e:Death Mark] breaks, it explodes and does additional damage to owner. Also, it charges the Spirit Form.
If [c/ff004e:Death Mark] kills an enemy, it replenishes Spirit Form.
[c/00cca2:So, you call this true melee, right?]
